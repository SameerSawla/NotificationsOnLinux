This is a small yet very useful shell script to help the user of the system to get notified for a task at a specific time. So that things that are due or are very important at that point in time are not missed.

This was developed out of situations where I would usually miss out on studying over social networking. This script notifies me on the time that I want to get off social network and focus back on studies. 

To run the script on BASH. 

(1). Download popTimer.
(2). It needs two arguments to run (a). time in millitary hours for that day
                                   (b). message to be notified with 

(3). chmod 755 popTimer
(4). Run it using the following command : 

  	 ./popTimer 1530 "Github is the best"

(5). This would notify "Github is the best", when time is 1530 Hrs.

Enhancements : 

Many enhancements could be pushed in this script to automate and drive the OS at a specific time. 
I felt a little lost and confused with crontab and thus came up with this that uses simple arguments which any layman could understand.
